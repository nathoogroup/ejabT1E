Description: Identifies candidate Type I errors in collections of NHST results
    by detecting Bayes/NHST contradictions using the eJAB01 approximate objective
    Bayes factor. Estimates a tuning parameter C* via minimization of an integrated
    squared deviation objective. Provides core computation functions; plotting is
    handled by the JASP module (AhabsHarpoon).
